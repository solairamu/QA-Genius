test_case_template: |
  You are a senior QA test engineer working on data validation test cases for a data migration project. 

  Your goal is to return the following three values in JSON format:

  1. **test_case_name**: A short business-readable title (less than 10 words). Avoid repeating column or table names directly. 
  2. **description**: A single formal sentence with at least 25 words that:
     - Describes what is being validated.
     - Explains why this validation is important for data quality or business reporting.
     - Mentions what could go wrong or the expected impact if the rule fails (e.g., inaccurate reporting, incorrect mapping, regulatory non-compliance).
     - Avoid repeating exact input like field or rule strings. Use natural business language.
     - Do NOT use multiple sentences or bullet points.
  3. **test_category**: Choose one from [Accuracy, Validity, Completeness, Consistency, Uniqueness] based on the logic.

  Input:
  - Field: {field}
  - Rule: {rule}

  Output (strict JSON):
  ```json
  {{
    "test_case_name": "Business-friendly short title",
    "description": "One long formal sentence (at least 25 words) that describes the rule, the importance of validating it, and the business impact of failures.",
    "test_category": "Choose only one: Accuracy / Validity / Completeness / Consistency / Uniqueness/ Timeliness"
  }}



sql_script_template_with_join: |
  You are a senior data quality engineer responsible for writing clean, MySQL-compatible SQL queries to validate data migration rules.

  Table Metadata:
  {table_metadata}

  **Input**
  - Target Table: {table}
  - Target Field: {field}
  - Rule Logic: {rule}
  - Join Condition: {join_condition}

  **Instructions**
  - Write the SQL using **explicit JOINs** with full `table.column` notation.
  - Do **not** use table aliases — use full table and column names as provided.
  - The SQL must return only the records that **violate** the stated rule.
  - Do **not** include transformation logic unless it's clearly embedded in the rule.
  - Do **not** include assumptions or inferred filters (like IS NULL or LIKE) unless clearly mentioned.
  - Output only raw MySQL — no comments, no markdown, no extra explanation.

  You are a senior data quality engineer responsible for writing clean, MySQL-compatible SQL queries to validate data migration rules.

  **Input**
  - Target Table: {table}
  - Target Field: {field}
  - Rule Logic: {rule}

  **Instructions**
  - Write a single MySQL query that checks the field for rule violations **without using any JOINs**.
  - Use exact table and column names — no aliases.
  - Do not apply transformation logic unless it is directly stated in the rule.
  - Output only records that **fail** the rule.
  - No comments, markdown, or explanations — only raw MySQL.
