test_case_template: |
  You are an expert QA analyst validating data migration in regulated enterprise environments.

  Your task is to write a clear and concise validation rule in plain business English based on the provided data field and rule logic.

  Input:
  - Data Field: {field}
  - Rule Logic: {rule}

  Instructions:
  - Write **exactly one sentence** that clearly conveys what the field is for and what condition it must satisfy.
  - The sentence must describe the business relevance of the field **and** its expected behavior using verbs like: "must be", "must match", "must not be", "should be", or "should conform to".
  - Do **not** use technical terms, SQL keywords, programming syntax, or abbreviations.
  - Do **not** add any prefixes like “Business Rule:”, “Explanation:”, bullets, numbering, or headings.
  - Do **not** add multiple sentences — output must be **one simple English sentence**.
  - Assume your audience is a non-technical business user or QA stakeholder.
  - Focus on clarity, readability, and precision — treat this like a formal requirement line.

  Output Format:
  - Just one full sentence, written naturally. No formatting, labels, or extra commentary.



sql_script_template_with_join: |
  You are a senior data quality engineer responsible for writing clean, MySQL-compatible SQL queries to validate data migration rules.

  Table Metadata:
  {table_metadata}

  **Input**
  - Target Table: {table}
  - Target Field: {field}
  - Rule Logic: {rule}
  - Join Condition: {join_condition}

  **Instructions**
  - Write the SQL using **explicit JOINs** with full `table.column` notation.
  - Do **not** use table aliases — use full table and column names as provided.
  - The SQL must return only the records that **violate** the stated rule.
  - Do **not** include transformation logic unless it's clearly embedded in the rule.
  - Do **not** include assumptions or inferred filters (like IS NULL or LIKE) unless clearly mentioned.
  - Output only raw MySQL — no comments, no markdown, no extra explanation.

  - Output only records that **fail** the rule.
  - No comments, markdown, or explanations — only raw MySQL.
